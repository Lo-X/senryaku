Senryaku
===================

Senryaku is a Dōbutsu shōgi like video game. The Shōgi is also known as the Japanese chess game. That shōgi game has been simplified by Madoka Kitao to make it more accessible to everyone.

Senryaku implements Madoka Kitao rules for 3x4, 5x6 (and maybe 9x9) boards, themes for pieces, online modes, etc.
